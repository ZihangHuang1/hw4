How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?

40 line, the canvas' width is known and we know the line has x += 10 as the distance between each line. Therefore 400 divided by 10 is 40. And each line is drawn means it runs one loop.

What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?

The first 10 means where it starts as x-axis, the second 10 means where it ends and the third 10 means each increment and the changing variable.
