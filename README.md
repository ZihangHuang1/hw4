1.How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?

40 line, the canvas' width is known and we know the line has x += 10 as the distance between each line. Therefore 400 divided by 10 is 40. And each line is drawn means it runs one loop.

2.What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?

The first 10 means where it starts as x-axis, the second 10 means where it ends and the third 10 means each increment and the changing variable.

1.How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?

6 Times, there are 6 variable will be used in x[]

2.What are two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?

one is to change the increment i = i + 10 and another one is to the variable 1 in 1 + (x.length - i)

How can you make the ellipse trail longer?

change the variable in   x = x.slice(-100);  y = y.slice(-100);
